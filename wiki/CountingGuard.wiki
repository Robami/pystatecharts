= Introduction =

CountingGuards are guards that have been designed with a counter and a threshold. 
The CountingGuard will return False until the threshold number of 
Events have been received. CountingGuards may be designed to retrigger, that is, after 
returning True, if not retrigger_enabled continue to return True. 
If retrigger_enabled, then return False until the count threshold is again reached.
